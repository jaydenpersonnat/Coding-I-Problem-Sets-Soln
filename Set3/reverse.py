                                # Reverse 

# Goal: to solidify for loops, strings, and indexing, we're going to create a program that reverses a string. 

"""
Your Mission: 
    Create a program called reverse.py that asks the user for a string. Then, 
    use a for loop to go through each character of the string in reverse order 
    and add each character to a new string. Then, print the contents of the new string.


Note that you can create an empty string like so:
    stuff = ""

You’ll might find it useful to utilize string concatenation to add characters 
to a letter. Check the following resources for help.

    https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-working-with-strings-in-python-3 

Example Run: 
    $ python reverse.py
    Please enter a string: hello, world!
    !dlrow, olleh

Done? 
    If you’ve managed to complete the implementation of reversed using a for 
    loop already, try to think of how you might otherwise implement this program! 
    You might find it useful to look into using Python’s built-in reversed() 
    function, which you can read about more here:

# Code goes below 

string = input("Please enter a string: ")

stuff = ""

for char in string:
    stuff = char + stuff

print(stuff)


# Using reversed () 

string = input("Please enter a string: ")

reversed_lst = list(reversed(string))

print("".join(reversed_lst))


# It can be even shorter using string slicing! 

name = input("Enter a string: ")[::-1]
print(name)

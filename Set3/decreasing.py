                            # Decreasing 

# Goal: Determine if a list of numbers is in decreasing order. 

"""
Background: This problem deals with lists of numbers. 
            Remember, a list can have no elements: []. 
            One element: ["cat"] 
            Five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            or any other number of elements. Say I create a variable that refers
            to a list, like this: 
                my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]

            This line of code says I have a variable my_list and its value 
            is set to the list ["a", "b", "c"].

            One thing we can do with a list is get elements out of it using 
            their index. The first element in a list is at index 0, the next 
            is at index 1, and so on.

            Another thing we can do with a list is append to it, or add something 
            to its end. If we have a list like this:
                numbers = [1, 2, 3]
            And then we do this: 
                numbers.append(4)

            Then numbers now has the value [1, 2, 3, 4]. Iâ€™ve appended 4 to the list.

            If I run the following code: 
                pets = []
                pets.append("cat")
                pets.append("dog")
                pets.append("fish")
            
            Then at the end pets has the value ["cat", "dog", "fish"].

Your Mission: 
    Write a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns 
    True if the list is in decreasing order and False otherwise.

    Hint: a list is in decreasing order if it is empty or if each of its 
    elements besides the last is greater than or equal to the next element.


Suggested Steps: 
    1. Detect if lists of 0 or 1 elements are decreasing 
    2. Add code to detect if lists of 2 elements are decreasing 
    3. Add code to detect if lists of 3 or 4 elements are decreasing 
    4. Use a loop instead to detect if lists of at least 1 element are decreasing 

Bonus: 
    Change your function to detect if a list first decreases and then increases 
    (but does not decrease again).

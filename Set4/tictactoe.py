                            # Tictactoe 

"""
Create a program that allows two people to play the game Tic-Tac-Toe. 

Background: 
    Tic-Tac-Toe
    Welcome to the classic and simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe, in which two players 
    take turns strategically placing their chosen symbol (and X or an O) in a 
    3 x 3 grid. The game ends when one of the players manages to place their 
    symbol in the three slots constituting a row, a column or diagonal, or when 
    all the slots become filled up and no one wins, resulting in a stalemate.

    If you’re familiar with the game, you’ll know that there are strategies you 
    can follow that ensure you always win the game (or that at least you never lose!). 
    You’ll get enough time to practice such strategies when you’ve finished 
    implementing our incomplete version of Tic-Tac-Toe, for which we’ve provided 
    you with some initial code, but we’re hoping you can help up finish it up! 
    We’re going to be using Python to complete the game! First, we’re going to 
    familiarize ourselves with some data structures, including lists and dictionaries.


    Lists
    In Python, we can create the list data structure, which quite literally 
    stores a sequence of elements in order such as the one below:
        grades = [91, 92, 87, 74, 95]

    If we want to know what the first element in this list is (remember that 
    in computer science we tend to use 0 to indicate the first element, 1 to i
    ndicate the second element, etc.), we can print it like so:
        # This will print 91
            print(grades[0])

    However, lists are useful when we want to store more than just simple values 
    like numbers. In real-world, we often use more complex structures to represent 
    information. For example, we might often need to somehow represent 
    two-dimensional data, such as data you might store in a table or a matrix. 
    Turns out, Python allows you to store lists within a list, which in other 
    programming contexts and languages may be referred to as 2D lists. If the 
    above list consisted of a simple list of grades of one student in a single 
    class, let’s imagine we wanted to store all of the same student’s grades, 
    but he is taking 3 classes instead of one. How do we ensure that the grades 
    for one class are distinct from the grades of another? We can use a 
    list of lists, like so:
        grades = [[91, 94, 89, 85, 89], [92, 92, 88, 89, 90], [90, 91, 86, 85, 90]]
        grades[2][3] 
    

    The above can be formatted to look like this:
        grades = [
		  [89, 94, 89, 85, 91],
		  [86, 92, 88, 89, 90],
		  [90, 91, 86, 85, 90],
		  [91, 93, 96, 89, 90]
		 ]

    And you can see how the above 2D list might correspond to a table like 
    the following:
        Class	 	 	 	 	 
        AP Chemistry	89	94	89	85	91
        AP Biology	    86	92	88	89	84
        AP Psychology	90	91	86	85	90
        AP English	    91	93	96	89	92

    The first element of grades here — grades[0] — is a list of numbers 
    [89, 94, 89, 85, 91]. The first element of this new list is grades[0][0] 
    == 89 and grades[0][1] == 94, grades[0][2] == 89, grades[1][0] == 86, 
    grades[1][1] == 92, grades[1][4] == 84

    When working with a list of lists, we tend to use nested loops. The first 
    loop iterates through the row number, the second loop runs through the 
    elements inside of a row. For example, this is how we might print the 
    contents of a 2D numerical list on the screen line by line, 
    eparating the numbers with spaces:
        a = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
        for i in range(len(a)):
            for j in range(len(a[i])):
                print(a[i][j], end=' ')
            print()
    
    The above snippet of code outputs:
        1 2 3 4
        5 6
        7 8 9

    Now that we are a bit more familiar with 2D lists, we’ll use them to 
    represent a 3 x 3 tic-tac-toe board!

    Lists in tictactoe.py 
    Open up tictactoe.py and on the first line of the main() function, you’ll see the following:
        board = [[] for _ in range(3)]

    In Python, this is known as a list comprehension, which is a very pythonic 
    and concise way of creating lists. The other square brackets contain an 
    expression follow by a for clause, which essentially resembles a shorthand 
    for the for loop itself. The below list comprehension and for loop both 
    achieve the same thing, creating the list [0, 1, 2]:
        new_list = [i for i in range(3)]
        new_list = []
        for i in range(3):
            new_list.append(i)

    Finally, sometimes in Python we don’t really care about putting real values 
    in a list and we simply want to create a list containing a set number of 
    values. If we wanted to create a list of three 1s using a list comprehension, 
    we could do it like so: new_list = [1 for _ in range(3)], which would create 
    the list [1, 1, 1].

    Thus, going back to the first line of main, what do you think that line 
    itself creates? Place a print statement to check your understanding of the 
    content of the variable board.

    Now, let’s look at the nested for loop following the initialization of the 
    board variable. On line 39 we have a for loop and in line 40 we have a 
    second (nested) for loop. Immediately after this, on line 41, we access 
    the board variable board[row]. Thinking back to what the board variable 
    contains, in the 2D lists section, we found that board is itself a list of 
    3 lists, each of the lists responding to a row in the 3 x 3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid. 
    Thus, in the first iteration of the for loop when row = 0, when accessing 
    board[0], we access the first list within board, which corresponds to the 
    first row of the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.

    Thus, with the outer for loop, we access each of the rows, board[0], board[1] 
    and board[2]. Then, in the inner for loop, to each of the rows we append a 
    number between 1 and 9, which will be displayed on the grid so that the 
    players can select a slot.

Your Mission:
    We’re going to create a program that allows two people to play the game 
    Tic-Tac-Toe ! Although the program is partially created, it looks like 
    there’s more work to be done!

    You’re going to tackle a few TODO’s in tictactoe.py.

1. winner(board)
    In tictactoe.py, you’ll see the function def winner(board):, which needs to 
    check whether in the current board configuration 
    (which you’ll be able to access and check through the board variable) 
    there is a winning pattern. In order to do this, you’ll need to:
        1. Check all rows to see if any one row has three identical symbols in it
        2. Check all columns to see if any one row has three identical symbols in it
        3. Check both diagonals to see if either of them has three identical symbols in it

    If any row, column or diagonal contains three identical symbols, that means 
    that the game was one, and you can return True. Otherwise, you should return False.

2. stalemate(board)
    You need to create the function that checks whether in the current board 
    configuration (which you can access through the board variable), there is a 
    stalemate. This happens when all the cells in the 3 x 3 board are filled in 
    a there is no row, column or diagonal that contains three identical 
    consecutive symbols.

    You should return True if there is a stalemate, and False otherwise.

    Hint: Remember that you can check whether a given cell has been played 
    (i.e. already has a symbol in it), when accessing the board variable. 
    If the top left element (the first element in the first row) is filled in, then 
    board[0][0] will contain an alphabetical character. If all slots 
    are filled in, they will all contain alphabetical characters (either ‘X’ or ‘O’);
    however, if there are empty slots, some will have numerical characters, 
    since the board starts out with 1-9. Think of how you might use Python’s 
    isalpha() method (you can read more about it here and here) to determine 
    whether all slots are filled in.

    If you can be clever about it, you could implement this function in one line! 
    You might want to look into using Python’s built-in all() function, 
    which returns True when all elements are true in an iterable object. To learn 
    more about it, visit this tutorial: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/all

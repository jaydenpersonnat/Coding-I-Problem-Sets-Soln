Create Connect Four!

Background:
    Connect four is a classic game for two players. The players take turns 
    dropping tokens into the columns of an upright rectangular board. 
    The first player to have four of their tokens in a row horizontally, 
    vertically, or diagonally wins. In this problem, you will implement a 
    command line version of Connect Four.

Distribution Code: 
    If you look in connect_four.py, you will see bare bones definitions of 
    the various functions you will need to complete to implement the game. 
    Each function has a docstring (in triple quotes) that describes what it 
    is supposed to do. Your task for this problem is to implement each of 
    these functions. That’s a lot of functionality to implement, but don’t 
    worry; we’ll go one step at a time. But first, let’s walk through the 
    distribution code to make sure we understand what is going on.

The Board: 
    At the top of file, we define two variables, BOARD_WIDTH and BOARD_HEIGHT. 
    Just below where the variables are defined, they are used to create the board, 
    which is a list of lists. Each of the inner lists represents a single row of 
    the board. Each cell of the board either contains None, which means it is 
    empty, or the number of the player whose token occupies that cell. The board 
    is initialized to be completely empty. 

    To see the board visualized, add a call to print_board in main and run the 
    program. As you can see, the board is empty (all None). Temporarily, add a 
    line like board[0][0] = 1 before your call to print_board. You should now 
    see that the board is no longer empty. Which board space is no longer empty? 
    Play around and try to figure out how to place a token (as the number 1 or 2) 
    in each corner of the board. Try to place four in a row horizontally, 
    vertically, and diagonally. Don’t forget to remove this code after you are 
    finished playing around with the board!

Your Mission: 
    Now that we understand how the board works, it’s time to implement connect 
    four! We’ll take it one step at a time. Click the “Next” button to get started.


1. Board Printing 
    If you play around with the board a little bit, you will quickly see that 
    the board is not very pretty. Your first task is to fix that by changing the
    implementation of print_board. Feel free to make the board look like anything 
    you want, but you can use the layout below to as inspiration. The only 
    requirement is that the board be pretty.
        |1 2 3 4 5 6 7|
        |. . . . . . .|
        |. . . . . . .|
        |. . . . . . .|
        |X . . . O O X|
        |O X . X O X X|
        |O O X O X X O|

    In this example layout Player 1’s tokens are represented with X, Player 2’s 
    tokens are represented with O, and empty spaces are represented with .. 
    Thus, if a 1 is on the board (meaning player 1 has played at that spot), 
    we want to print out an X instead!

    Below is pseudocode describing how to print the example layout. 
    Feel free to use it if you get stuck on your own design!

        headers := list of numbers 1 to BOARD_WIDTH
        print vertical bars ("|") around header numbers joined by spaces

        for each row in the board:
        tokens := empty list
        for each column in the row:
            if cell at row, column is None, then append "." to tokens
            if cell at row, column is 1, then append "X" to tokens
            if cell at row, column is 2, then append "O" to tokens
        print vertical bars around strings in cells joined by spaces

    Challenge: How can you make the code shorter by using this dict?
        {None: ".", 1: "X", 2: "O"}

    Don’t forget to test your implementation of print_board by adding tokens to 
    the board and calling print_board in main!

2. Validating Input
    Now that we can display the board, we need to let the users add their tokens to the board. 
    The first step to do this is to get input from the user. The function for this
    is get_move. Right now get_move accepts any input, but we want the input to 
    be validated, meaning bad input should be rejected. Valid input is any 
    integer between 1 and BOARD_WIDTH, inclusive. The input identifies which 
    column the user wants to drop a token into. If the user enters bad input, 
    they should be repeatedly prompted until they enter valid input.
    
    Add a call to get_move to main and implement input validation in get_move. 
    When you are done, your program might look something like this:
        $ python connect_four.py
        Enter a column number: abc123
        Invalid input. Enter a column number: 0
        Invalid input. Enter a column number: 10
        invalid input. Enter a column number: -1
        invalid input. Enter a column number: 3

        The messages can be whatever you want, but the important part is that the
        program keeps asking for input until a valid column number is given.

3. Updating the Board 
    Now that we can get correct input from the user, we need to be able to update 
    the board accordingly. Go ahead and change the implementation of make_move 
    to update the board. make_move takes two arguments, the player making the 
    move and the column they want to play. Remember that in Connect Four tokens 
    always fall down as far as possible, so there should never be an empty space 
    under a token. Don’t worry about detecting wins yet; make_move should still 
    just return False at this point.

    To test your implementation of make_move, place the following in the body of main:
        column = get_move()
        make_move(1, column)
        print_board()

    When you run the program you should be able to make a move and see that a 
    token for Player 1 is placed at the bottom of the correct column.

4. The Game Loop 
    Now that we have the functionality in place for a player to make a move and 
    see the results, it’s time to implement the high-level logic of the game. 
    Specifically, players should be able to alternate taking turns and seeing 
    the results until someone wins. Don’t worry that you haven’t implemented 
    win detection in make_move yet; for now just assume that it works as 
    specified in make_move’s docstring and we will go back and implement it for 
    real later.

    Implement the following pseudocode for the game logic in main. When you’re 
    done, you should be able to have two players alternate taking turns, with 
    the board state being printed before each turn. The game will probably never 
    end, since we haven’t implemented that part yet, so to quit the program you 
    will have to press Control-C.

    At the bottom of the file, the high-level game logic is implemented in a loop 
    in main. Each turn is a single iteration of this loop. You can see that on 
    each turn the board is printed, and the current player’s input is processed. 
    If the current player has won the final board is printed and the loop is broken, 
    ending the game. Otherwise, if the current player did not win, the current 
    player is switched and a new turn begins.
        current player := 1
        repeat:
            print the board
            print a message saying whose turn it is
            get input and make a move
            if that was the winning move:
                print the final board
                print a message announcing the win
                stop repeating and end program
            otherwise switch the current player and repeat

    4. Full Columns 
        Yay! Users can now take turns making moves. However, what happens if a 
        user plays on a full column? Try it out and see what happens. Your code 
        will probably either do nothing or crash. Neither result is what we 
        want, so go back to get_move and add to the input validation a 
        requirement that the chosen column is not full.

    5. Detecting Wins 
        The game is now fully playable except for the fact that it never ends. 
        Design an algorithm for checking if a player’s move is a winning move. 
        Remember that a move is a winning move if it completes a sequence of 
        four identical tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
        Implement your algorithm in make_move, returning True if the move 
        was a winning move and False otherwise.

        This is the hardest part of this project, so we highly recommend that 
        you work with your neighbors to figure out a working algorithm. It would 
        also be a good idea to write down the algorithm as pseudocode on paper 
        before trying to implement it.

        If you are truly stuck, you can press the Next button to see pseudocode 
        for a solution to this problem, but do try to work with your neighbors 
        to come up with an algorithm on your own first. A lot of the fun of 
        programming is trying to come up with algorithms like this!

            for direction in horizontal, vertical, diagonal left, and diagonal right:
            adjacent_matches := 1
            for each step in forward direction from move location
                    until we are off the board or see a different player's token:
                adjacent_matches += 1
            for each step in backward direction from move location
                    until we are off the board or see a different player's token:
                adjacent_matches += 1
            if adjacent matches >= 4, this is a winning move

        
        The main idea is to move forward and backward along every possible win 
        direction (horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals) from the location 
        of the player’s move, counting the number of adjacent identical tokens 
        as we go. The trick is in how you represent directions. Think about how 
        row numbers and column numbers change as you travel in each of these directions.

    6. Handling Draws 
        Unfortunately the code currently has no way of detecting when a game 
        should be over because there are no more possible moves. Your final 
        task is to fix this in any way you see fit. This will require you to 
        make changes to the game loop in main.

    Congrats! You have a working command line version of Connect Four. Here are 
    some optional bonus challenges to make the program more interesting and flexible.


Bonus challenges
    1. Switch the player at the end of the turn using a single line of code without using an if.
    2. Make the game have three players instead of just two.
    3. Take the size of the board and the number of players as command line arguments 
        so they can be different each time the program is run.
    4. The board initialization uses list multiplication to create rows of the 
        correct length, but uses a loop to create the right number of rows. 
        Comment out the distribution code’s board initialization loop and 
        replace it with the following:
            # board = []
            # for row in range(BOARD_HEIGHT):
            #     board.append([None] * BOARD_WIDTH)
            board = [[None] * BOARD_WIDTH] * BOARD_HEIGHT

    This code uses list multiplication to create both the inner lists and outer list. 
    Does it work? Can you explain why or why not?

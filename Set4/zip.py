                                # Zip 

"""
Write a function that takes a list of integers such as 
[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7] and returns a dictionary of each integer and 
the number of times it occurs in the list {1:1, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1, 5:3, 6:2, 7:1}. 

Hint: define a separate function called zip that returns a dictionary, and a 
print it out using the main function.

Example Run: 
    lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7]

    print(zip(lst))
    
    python zip.py 
    {1:1, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1, 5:3, 6:2, 7:1}

Bonus: Unzip 
Write a function that takes a dictionary of each integer and the number of times 
it occurs in the list such as {1:1, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1, 5:3, 6:2, 7:1} and returns a 
list of integers [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7].

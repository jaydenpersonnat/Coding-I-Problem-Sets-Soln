# Speller 

## Goal 
Implement a program that spell-checks a file, per the below.

## Background 
Let’s build ourselves a very simple spellchecker and actually use it to check 
the spelling of a number of texts! We’re going to do so using Python to implement 
our spellchecker, but first we’re going to take a look at classes, methods and file input/output.

#### Classes 
In the real world, there are often entities that we want to represent that aren’t 
fully covered by simple data types like integers and strings or by data structures 
like lists and dictionaries. Turns out, it’s really useful to have a way to represent more 
complex entities, especially if you have many of them! For example, in the case 
of products like Facebook or Google, when people use their services, there is a 
lot of information associated with each person, and it’s not enough to just keep 
track of their name and/or email address. This is where classes come in. Classes in 
Python allow us to create new data structures and you can think of them kind of like 
super variables in the sense that it’s up to you what kind of information you can 
store for each class and what kind of capabilities each class will have. 

According to the Python documentation, Python classes allow us to package data 
and functionality together and “Creating a new class creates a new type of 
object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance 
can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances 
can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.”

So we can see that a class is essentially a fundamental building block in Python. 
Consider the example below, in which we look at a potential implementation of a 
class for a customer at a bank:

```
class Customer():

    def __init__(self, name, balance=0.0)
        self.name = name
        self.balance = balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
        self.balance -= amount
        return self.balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        return self.balance
```


```
maria = Customer("Maria Zlatkova", 3000.0)
print(maria.balance) # Prints 3000
```

```
maria.deposit(1500)
print(maria.balance) # Prints 4500
maria.withdraw(2000)
print(maria.balance) # Prints 2500
```

#### File I/O 
A file is a named location on disk that stores information. Files can be documents, 
images, tex files, and many more.

When we want to work with a file in our Python scripts, we have the option to read 
the content of the file or write content to the file. However, before we can 
read from or write to a file we need to open it first. When we are done, the 
file needs to be closed, so that the file can be otherwise used and the resources 
that are tied with the file are freed.

##### Open a file 
Python has a built-in function open() to open a file. This function returns a file 
object, which we can use throughout our code

```
f = open("test.txt")    # open file in current directory
f = open("~/Desktop/python/test.txt")  # specifying full path
```

##### Read or write (perform operation)
When opening the file, we have the option to either read ‘r’, write ‘w’ or append 
‘a’ to the file. The default mode in which a file is opened is the read mode. 
which allows us to extract strings from the file.

You can also open a file in write mode, which allows you to write to the file:
```
file = open(“test.txt”,”w”)

file.write(“Hello, world!”)
file.write(“This is a new text file”)
file.write(“and this is another line.”)
file.write(“Goodbye, world!”)

file.close()
```

When we want to read all the lines from a file we can use a for loop: 
```
file = open(“test.txt”, “r”)
for line in file:
	print(line) 
```

For the above test.txt file that we just created and wrote to, the above loop 
and print statements would output:

```
Hello, world!
This is a new text file
and this is another line.
Goodbye, world!

```

##### Close the file 
```
f = open("test.txt")
# perform file operations
f.close()
```

## Your Mission 
We’re going to create a program that can spellcheck bodies of text when given a 
dictionary against which to reference the correct spelling of worlds.

You’re going to tackle a few TODO’s in dictionary.py.

0. ```def __init__self()``` <br> 
In the init method we’ll want to initializa the dictionary, and in order to do so, 
you should create the words instance variable and assign it to an empty set, 
where you will store the words contained in the dictionary.

1. ```def check(self, word)``` <br> 
In this method, you’ll want to check whether a given word is present in the 
dictionary. In order to do so, you are passed the word argument, which itself is 
a string coming from the text that is being spellchecked. You should return True 
if word is contained in the set of words in the dictionary, accessible through 
the words instance variable which you should’ve create in the __init__ method.

Hint: Open up dictionary.txt and take a look at all the words contained in the 
dictionary. All of the words should be lowercase, which means that you’ll want 
to manipulate the word variable passed into this method to make it all lowercase 
as well before you check whether it is contained in the set of words.


2. ```def load(self, dictionary)``` <br> 
In this method, you’ll want to load the words from the dictionary file. You’ll 
want to accomplish to following things:
    1. Open the dictionary file 
    2. Go through all the lines of the file and for each line in the file, add 
    the word in the set of words in the words instance variable

    Hint: a for loop might be useful here to go through all the lines of the file. 
    For each line, you’ll want to add it to the words instance variable in order 
    to make sure that our set contains all the words in the file. However, if you 
    simple add the line to the set, that will add the string itself and the newline
    at the end of the string (since in dictionary.txt, there is one word per line 
    followed by a newline). How can you get rid of this newline ( \n ) character? 
    Take a look at Python’s ```rtstrip()``` method here and here

    3. Close the file and return ```True``` when you are done working with the file

3. ```def size(self)``` <br> 
In this method, you’ll want to return the total size of the dictionary.

Hint: Given that all the words in the dictionary should we stored in the words 
instance variable, how might you get the total number of words in that set?

## Testing Your Program 
To run and test your program, you’ll want to execute:

```
python speller.py {text}
```

Where {text} stands for the path to a text you might want to spellcheck. 
You have a few options to choose from:

```
texts/aca.txt
texts/birdman.txt
texts/constitution.txt
texts/frankenstein.txt
texts/her.txt
texts/lalaland.txt
texts/shakespeare.txt
```

So, a sample command might be:

```
python speller.py texts/her.txt
```

For aca.txt, the expected output should be:

```
Total number of words in text: 362942
Number of misspelled words: 16143
```

For birdman.txt, the expected output should be: 
```
Total number of words in text: 21714
Number of misspelled words: 1568
```

For constitution.txt, the expected output should be: 
```
Total number of words in text: 7543
Number of misspelled words: 50
```

For frankenstein.txt, the expected output should be: 
```
Total number of words in text: 79602
Number of misspelled words: 2430
```

For her.txt, the expected output should be: 
```
Total number of words in text: 18356
Number of misspelled words: 1218
```

For lalaland.txt, the expected output should be: 
```
Total number of words in text: 17526
Number of misspelled words: 1304
```

For shakespeare.txt, the expected output should be: 
```
Total number of words in text: 899787
Number of misspelled words: 45934
```

                            # Lister 

"""
Create a program that asks the user for a length of a shopping list, allows the 
user to fill that list, and then prints the contents of that list to the screen.


Background:
    To solidify for loops, lists, and appending, we’re going to play around with a 
    problem that allows us to create a shopping list.


Your Mission: 
    Create a program called lister.py that asks the user for an integer representing 
    a length of a needed shopping list to be constructed. Then, with a for loop, 
    fill the contents of a list of strings of the length given to you. 
    Lastly, print the contents to the screen!

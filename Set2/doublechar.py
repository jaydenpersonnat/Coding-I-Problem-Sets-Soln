                        # Double Char 

"""
Create a program that asks the user for a string, and then doubles the 
characters in the string and prints the resulting string.


Background: 
    To solidify for loops, strings, and concatenating, we’re going to play 
    around with a problem that double the characters in a string.


Your Mission: 
    Write program called double_char.py, that asks the user for a string 
    and prints a string where for every char in the original, there are two chars.

    For the following inputs, your program should pronounce the following output:
        The --> TThhee
        AAbb --> AAAAbbbb
        Hi There --> HHii  TThheerree

You might find it useful to utilize a for loop to go through each character 
in the string, and for each character, add the same letter twice to a new string.

stuff = ""

You’ll want to use string concatenation to add the same letters twice.

Example Run:
    $ python double_char.py
    Please enter a string: Hello World!
    HHeelloo  WWoorrlldd!!

# Code goes below 
string = input("Please enter a string: ")

for char in string:
    print(char * 2, end = "")

print()
